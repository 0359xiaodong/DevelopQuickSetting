###DevelopQuickSetting
-------------
This app is for those who develop android application. If you want to toggle developer settings, you have to go to setting -> developer setting -> fling a long list and choose the item you wanted to toggle.  

This cause us so much time! So I develop this application. It provides a simple UI to toggle the developer setting we used the most. You can also place a widget on your launcher, you can use it to toggle setting with a minimum of time.

At last, this app is opensource on [https://github.com/kyze8439690/DevelopQuickSetting](https://github.com/kyze8439690/DevelopQuickSetting).
